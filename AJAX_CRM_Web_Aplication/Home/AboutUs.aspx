                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We have been building web applications now for a few years now. All the time we
                    wondered why the conversion from websites was so low. We realised that there were
                    no decent methods for web visitors to reach business owners. Most mentods were custom
                    built and users had to look for ways to reach the business.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Contact Us Pages: These may be the oldest of web pages since the big bang. Yet contact
                    us pages are not very popular . As visitors are afraid of getting spammed and their
                    contacts being sold.<br />
                    <br />
                    Click to Call: Click to call is interesting. but most users are researching businesses
                    after office hours. Or are not ready to call right away. So the click to call becomes
                    another contact us page.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In all these cases the concept of capturing, tracking and closing leads is missing.
                    This is where delightDesktook shape. We felt there was a need for a system where users
                    could connect to businesses securely.
