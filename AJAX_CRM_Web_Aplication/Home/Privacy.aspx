   1.  Scope
      This privacy policy intended to describe our online information practices and the choices 
      you can make about the way your information is collected and used for our services on 
      CustomerSupport.com website. You are advised to please read the Privacy Policy carefully. To make 
      this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where 
      personal identification information may be requested. By accessing the services provided 
      by the Website you agree to the collection and use of your data by JustOnDemand in the 
      manner provided in this Privacy Policy.
      
   2. Collection of Information
      You can browse the Sites without disclosing any personal information about yourself. 
      Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to 
      provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that 
      information to our servers. While ordering products and services displayed in CustomerSupport.com 
      website, it is necessary for you to disclose certain personal information. These types of 
      personal information collected at these pages include but are not limited to:
      -Name
      -Address
      -Email address
      -Phone number
      -Date of Birth
      -Credit/Debit Card Information
      If the information provided by you cannot be verified, before shipping any products ordered 
      online, CustomerSupport.com has the right to ask you for additional information (such as your driver 
      license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your 
      address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.

   3. Information Sharing and Disclosure
      JustOnDemand does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or 
      nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, or under the 
      following circumstances:

         1. We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with JustOnDemand 
         under confidentiality agreements. JustOnDemand works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and 
         other service providers in different industries and categories of business. These companies 
         may have access to certain personal information needed to perform their functions. But these 
         companies are under obligation not to use that information for any other purpose. By law, we 
         sometimes must release account and other personal information when we believe release is 
         necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; 
         or protect the rights, property, or safety of CustomerSupport.com, our users, or others. This may 
         include exchanging information with State or Central Government officials, as well as other 
         companies and organizations to increase fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This is 
         for our customers' own good and protects all of us.
         2. We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. We send you announcements 
         only if you opt for receiving updates on our new products and services. You will be sent a 
         confirmation e-mail and procedure to remove your address from such mailings if you wish. 
         Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
         3. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share 
         with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited 
         a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our 
         registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those 
         individuals.
         4. Finally, we never use or share the personal identification information provided to us 
         on-line in ways unrelated to the ones described above without providing you an opportunity to 
         opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
   4. Account Protection
      Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters 
      and do not disclose your CustomerSupport.com password to anyone. If you do share your password or your 
      personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the 
      name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over 
      your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. 
      Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify 
      CustomerSupport.com and change your password.
   5. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information
      You can see, review and change most of your personal information by logging into the Site. 
      Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to 
      verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or 
      is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from 
      view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. 
      We do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect 
      any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our CustomerSupport.com 
      Terms Of Use Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
   6. Security
      Your information is stored on our servers located in the data center. We treat data as an asset that must be 
      protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal 
      information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may 
      unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse 
      your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect 
      your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private 
      communications will always remain private.
   7. Third Parties
      Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and 
      disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are 
      users on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure 
      of the information you disclose to them. Since CustomerSupport.com does not control the privacy policies of third parties, 
      you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose 
      your personal information to others.
   8. General
      We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site. All amended terms automatically 
      take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
